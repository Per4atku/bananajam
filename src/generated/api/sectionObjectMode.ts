/**
 * Indicates the modality (major or minor) of a section, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. This field will contain a 0 for "minor", a 1 for "major", or a -1 for no result. Note that the major key (e.g. C major) could more likely be confused with the minor key at 3 semitones lower (e.g. A minor) as both keys carry the same pitches.
